  fileSet node attributes:
    frequency: sets the frequency of the input files, 1=every file, 2=every other file etc.
    fileRange: gives the location of the SPHERLS model dumps and the range to include in making the hdf files
    timeFile: where to store the time informaion
    outputPath: where to put the hdf files
  
  radialCutZone node: sets how many radial zones from the inner part of the model that are removed from the hdf file
  includeBoundaries: should the theta and phi boundaries be included
  numRInterp: how many radial zones should be used when interpolating to a regularly space grid in the radial direction
