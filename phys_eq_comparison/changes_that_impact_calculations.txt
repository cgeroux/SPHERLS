**calNewE_RT_NA_LES:
-moved radii form time centered values to values at n
-found an error in the surface boundary condition where
 dRho_iph1halfjk_n was being set by accessing a rho at i+1, which
 doesn't exist, this was in the 2D explicit region, so it probably
 wouldn't ever effect the calculation unless no implicit calculation
 was being done. (this change resulted in a very small change in the
 dump files, the relative temperature differences were on the order of
 1e-12 at the largest)
 
calNewE_RTP_NA_LES:
-fixed a surface boundary condition for dEGrad_ip1halfjk_np1half, it
 should be set to zero. But this should not make any difference unless
 the calculation is done without an implicit region at the surface
 (made no difference in dumps)

****calNewEddyVisc_RTP_SM,calNewEddyVisc_RT_SM:
-changed R at np1 to np1half, it should be properly time centered.
 Could this have something to do with the 3D/1D instability? (both had
 caused a relative temperature difference of at most 1e-8 and was
 largest near the hydrogen ionization zone)

calNewU_R:
-when calculating u_ijk_nm1half it was from
 (u[i+1][j][k]+u[i][j][k])*0.5 when it should have been 
 (u[i][j][k]+u[i-1][j][k])*0.5, it shouldn't make any differnece as it
 was used in the A1 term, which should be always zero.
-removing dA1 from calculation, as it should be zero all the time.
 (found a small difference in dump files ~1e-9, checked out to make
 sure that dA1 was zero all the time, it wasn't quite, u-u_0 seems to
 be non-zero at the 1e-9 level, and dA1 is non-zero at the 1e-36 level)

****calNewV_RT_LES:
-missed a factor of pi in the radial eddy viscosity term
-missed a factor of pi in the a1 term
 (relative differences in the theta velocities as large as 1e-3.
 Largest reltative differences are in the hydrogen ionization zone,
 this effected the other variables aswell)

dImplicitEnergyFunction_R_SB:
-when calculating dE_im1jk_np1half from equation of state, I used rho_i
 instead of rho_im1, but this is only used in the A1 term which for a
 1D calculation will always be zero (made no difference in dumps)

****dImplicitEnergyFunction_R:
-it added Q0 twice to the pressure, this could cause s1 to be larger
 than it should when there is compression (didn't notice any difference
 in the dumps, probably means that the 1D reference calculations are
 pretty tame, and the artificial viscosity isn't playing a role.
 Perhaps I should get a better set of 1D reference calculations)

calNewU0_RT:
-removed terms including flow in theta direction, slight relative
 changes in u_0 and u at and near the surface respectively of ~1e-14.

dImplicitEnergyFunction_RTP_LES:
-updating this caused relative differences in the velocities of the
 model dump with the largest 1e-9 but most were around 1e-14. The
 larger relative differences were for smaller velocities (1e-2 ish).
