SPHERLS simulates the interaction of radial pulsation and convection in
stars.

Below are the basic instructions for building. To find out more on how
to use the SPHERLS packages see user manuals in the docs/manuals
directory, especially SPHERLS_manual.pdf in which the installation of
prerequisite libraries is described.

To build and install:

  ./configure
  make

If not a distribution package (will have gotten it from the git repository):
one can run:

  autoreconf --install

to create the ./configure file if the GNU build tools are installed
